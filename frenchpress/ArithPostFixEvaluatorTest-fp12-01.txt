These methods are declared public but never called outside their own class:
     setup (15)
     testEvaluateSimple (20)
     testEvaluatePlus (26)
     testEvaluateSub (38)
     testEvaluateMult (50)
     testEvaluateNegate (62)
     testInvalidExpression (74)
You could declare them private instead.
